# Concentration-2020
Swift code for Stanford's iTunes University course CS193P, 2017 edition, assignment one--Concentration game.

The first assignment for CS193P was a concentration game. A deck of 24 cards (12 sets of matched cards) is laid face-down on the table; the player turns over pairs of cards with the goal of finding matches. Several themes are built into the game as well as a simple scoring system.

The commits represent various stages in course instruction and improvements to the code, with a view to showcasing how the code evolved in light of the lectures and my own learning.

Of note is the fact that Swift is evolving; in some cases, code suggested in lectures has been deprecated, and in other cases, new methods etc. are available which simplify things. I have endeavoured to provide the code as originally suggested (generally in comment form) and outlined the nature of the changes in light of Swift 5.2.
